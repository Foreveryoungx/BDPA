### The steps to planning your project successfully

## Define your Project

#### What is an appropriate capstone project? ####

- What is a "business problem" that you want to solve?  Do you have anything in your personal life that frustrates you that you could see an app solving in some way?
- Do you have a business  yourself that you could see an app solving a business problem you have?
- Do you have a friend or someone you know with a business that could use an app to solve a business problem?
- Do you have a product or a service that you would like to create an app for and build a web presence?  Ecommerce site?
- Do research on websites - Google to see if someone has already made an application based on your idea - pick it apart to see what you like, do not like and how you can make it better. 

#### Capstone Project Guidelines: ####

- Students must complete and effective present a capstone project.  Said project will meet the following general requestments:
    - Display an effective approach to the project planning process.  This includes wire frames, UI/UX design, Trello board.
    - Display an understanding of semantic HTML and modern CSS approaches.
    - Render as a Single Page Application using a 'state' object and a 'render' function to display 'views'.
    - Demonstrate the use of Git, including a sensical, well-organized 'commit' history
    - Use an external API to send/receive data and update the Single Page Application views
    - Incorporate a backend Restful API using Node.js, Express.js and MongoDB
    - Deploy Single Page Application and Backend API to Netlify and Heroku respectively.
    - Should display your development skills and creativity in a professional manner
    - Can be completed in the allotted time frame.

## Define your Audience

#### Who is the target audience for the capstone project?  Do research! ####

- It's not you!
- Mentor & Peers
- Recruiters & Career Coaches
- Hiring Managers
- Ultimately the consumer of your product

How is your idea different, better, define your audience and run your ideas by them to get feedback on what they would like to see in an application?  Document their feedback and keep in mind / refer to as your building out your application.

## Determine what YOUR project will be. ##

#### Create a high level story you want tell with your project. ####

- This will be your elevator pitch for your capstone project and used during demo day.

"I want to create a web APPLICATION that allows users to ask questions via chat during a talk and add resources to videos."

---

## Define your Content

#### Determine what pages you need and the content of each page. ####

- Don't worry about look and feel or style of the content, that comes later.

1. Make a list of pages
1. Write a brief description of the content for each page
    1. Navigation
    1. Main Content
    1. Footer

---

## Define your User Flow ##

#### What interactions will the user be required to do to use your web application. ####

Example: E-commerce Application

![Sample User FLow](img/Savvy_Coders_User_Flow_Example.png)

- Focus on page flow not content of pages
- Make sure you analyze all user flows, creating multiple flow charts if necessary.

## Create Wire Frames ##

#### Now that you think you know what you want to create.

- The wireframes should be crude.  We are not creating pixel perfect representations of your website.
- Start with pencil and paper or whiteboard
   - Then if desired, move into a digital version.
- Create at least one per page.
   - If a page has suffocated user interaction, multiple wireframes for a single page may be required.
- Create wireframes for both different screen sizes.  I.E.: mobile and desktop.
- They should be proportionally correct.
- They should identify the content to be placed on each page but not display actual content.
- They should annotate any user interactions.

#### Start with pencil and paper or whiteboard, then if necessary create a digital version

## Homework! - Create Documentation ##

1. If you have not done so yet - create an account for yourself on Github [www.github.com](www.github.com).   Make sure the name is professional.
1. If you haven't already done so, create your capstone repo from the [Savvy Starter](https://github.com/savvy-coders/savvy-starter) template and clone your capstone repo.
1. Navigate to your capstone repo on your local development environment
1. Create a docs folder and add documentation in the form of markdown, images or PDFs.
    1. [Documenting your projects on GitHub](https://guides.github.com/features/wikis/)
    1. [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
1. Update your README.md file to link to your new project documentation

### Your documentation should include... ###
- Definition of your audience (We already did this, correct?)
- Definition statement (I want to create a web application that...) for your project
- High level story (elevator pitch)
- Outline of the content
- User Flow
- Wire frames (1 wireframe per page minimum, hand-drawn is ok!)

The documentation will be included in your portfolio, so make it look nice.
